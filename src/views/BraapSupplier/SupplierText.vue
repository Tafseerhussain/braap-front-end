            Our customers are not just transactional they use our technology to diagnose, maintenance, and fix
            mechanical things. Our users and technicians solve problems, schedule, setup and track logistics, record
            time, and manage billing in Braap. We are a leading technician solution focused on simplifying service and
            built for hundreds of daily interactions that result in parts orders and a lasting relationship.

            Braap technology makes it easier to find parts. Instead of the traditional schematic approach, we create
            links between the diagnostics and the required parts. Our patent-pending technology is dynamic and organizes
            the taxonomy of parts using machine learning and custom curation to ensure the right fit for every part and
            machine or asset. Users and technicians like the speed and accuracy of navigating from a diagnostic to the
            right parts.
          </p>
          <p class="my-6">
            Our broad, yet focused, industry capabilities allow users and technicians to manage any type of mechanical
            machine or asset. From powersport, heating and cooling, home appliance, bikes, mowers, medical equipment,
            electronic devices, and anything else that has parts. Braap is built with flexibility so a technician can be
            working on an ATV engine one minute and a cooling pump the next.
